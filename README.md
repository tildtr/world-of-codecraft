# World of Codecraft

A high-fantasy layout for [Herdr](https://herdr.dev). Your coding agents become heroes
in Valbrume, a village drawn in isometric pixel art, built around one big terminal.

![World of Codecraft](preview.png)

- **Every agent is a hero.** Its class comes from the program it runs: Claude Code is a
  Mage at the tower, Codex an Artificer at the forge, Gemini a Priest at the temple,
  OpenCode a Ranger at the barn, and so on. Its race and name come from its terminal.
- **The village shows what each hero is doing.** A hero who needs you raises a flashing
  `!`. A hero who has finished shows a golden `?`. Idle heroes sit around the campfire.
- **With the optional activity integration, heroes act out the work itself.** A hero
  reading code scouts at the forest edge under circling ravens. Editing code or running
  commands, it fights a creature (imp, wolf, goblin, boar, rust golem, spectre), one blow per successful edit; a
  task full of failures brings a troll boss. Tests are a training dummy, a commit gets a wax
  seal, a push sends a carrier pigeon, compaction is meditation, and every subagent is a
  wisp.
- **The village lives on its own.** Villagers walk the road, hens peck by the barn, a cat
  naps at the tavern, fish leap in the river, a stag comes out at dawn, and a guard with a
  lantern walks the night.
- **An immersive mode** (header button or ctrl-shift-i), in the same layout, swaps the village and the
  terminal: the village fills the window at the same resolution, on a map three times taller with a forest to the north and fields and
  groves to the south, and you drag it to look around.
- **Spaces are districts and tabs are quests,** on the left, with heraldic banners.
- **Days and nights** follow your clock, with lit windows, a glowing forge and smoking
  chimneys.
- **French or English,** picked from your system language.
- **An « Animations » switch** under the minimap turns everything to still images when you
  want to save CPU.
- **A warm terminal theme**: dark oak background, parchment text and a gold cursor. The text size is
  yours: the layout leaves it to Herdr's settings.

## About this fork

This branch (`my-customization`) is a personal fork of
[kevinpardo/world-of-codecraft](https://github.com/kevinpardo/world-of-codecraft) by Kevin Pardo,
used under its MIT License (see `LICENSE`; the fonts stay under the SIL Open Font License). It adds:

- **A Files / Changes panel on the right** (Herdr's stock `files` and `changes` mods), opened from
  the top-bar buttons or `ctrl-shift-e` / `ctrl-shift-g`.
- **A Middle-earth theme**: Hobbiton and the Shire, hobbits and barrow-wights, hobbit mealtimes,
  realm pennants. It covers text, names and colours only. The pixel art is the original's. This is
  an unofficial fan customization, not affiliated with the Tolkien Estate or any rights holder.

To install this fork, clone it instead of the original and run `tools/install.sh` as below.

To pull in the original's updates:

```sh
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main
tools/install.sh
```

Conflicts are most likely in `mods/world-of-codecraft/i18n.js`, `fronton.js`, `kit.js` and the layout.

## Install

Ask your agent to add `herdr.dev/layouts/kevinpardo/world-of-codecraft`, or:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kevinpardo/world-of-codecraft
cd world-of-codecraft
tools/install.sh                  # copies the layout, theme and mod into ~/.config/herdr-app
herdr-app do layout.switch '{"name":"World-of-Codecraft"}'
```

Then merge `mods/world-of-codecraft/KEYS.json` into your `keys.json`: `ctrl-shift-i`
switches the immersive mode, `ctrl-shift-j` toggles the village and `ctrl-shift-b` toggles
the left column. Run `tools/install.sh`
again after a `git pull`. It installs real files, not symlinks: Herdr loads images and
reloads mods only from real files inside its home.

### Activity scenes (optional)

The scenes need each agent to say what it is doing. Two small integrations write that to
`~/.local/state/world-of-codecraft/<terminal>.json`:

```sh
tools/install.sh --integrations
```

- **OpenCode:** the plugin is linked into `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` and loads at the
  next start.
- **Claude Code:** the hook is linked to `~/.claude/hooks/wocc-activity.py`. Register it
  in `~/.claude/settings.json` for these events: `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`,
  `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `PreCompact`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`,
  `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`. Each entry looks like this:

  ```json
  { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "python3 \"$HOME/.claude/hooks/wocc-activity.py\" 2>/dev/null || true", "timeout": 5 }] }
  ```

  The hook answers `{"async": true}` at once, so it never slows Claude down, and does
  nothing outside Herdr.

## Language

The interface is in French when your system language is French, and in English otherwise.
To force one, start Herdr with `WOCC_LANG=fr` or `WOCC_LANG=en`.

## What it reads and runs

- The activity files above, if the integrations are installed.
- The Claude quota files of the author's two-account setup, cduo
  (`~/.local/state/claude-duo/quota-{A,B}.json`), only if they exist. They add the gold
  and wood gauges, the treasury and the fair; otherwise those stay hidden.
- Once per start, `sh` to read your system language.

The mod makes no network calls.
